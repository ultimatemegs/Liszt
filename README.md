What is List Length Analysis?

Lists are species data that, at a minimum, constitute a list of species identified during a survey, from which the number of species encountered (list length) can be calculated. List Length Analysis (LLA) is a technique developed to estimate population trends from lists using logistic regression in a Bayesian framework.

The Liszt package provides a straightforward way of conducting a Bayesian List Length Analysis of change through time using species list . It permits multi-species evaluation using both the framework described in Szabo et al. (2010) for estimating trends, and the extension for estimating comparative trends after Barnes et al. (2014 online).

Its basically a slightly easier to use logistic regression specified in rjags tailored to a highly specific purpose, and it comes with some graphical outputs etc.

The package can be found on the edg webpage (Version 0.8.5) and here (most recent version)
A guide to using it can be found here: http://www.edg.org.au/edg-free-resources/list-length.html
At some point i will probably move the guide etc here.
